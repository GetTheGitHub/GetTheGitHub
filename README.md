### Hi there, i'm GetTheGitHub, a developer and artist ðŸ‘‹

My goal is to make the web more accessible for everyone with *the universal design* approach, clean code and functionianlity.  

<!--
**GetTheGitHub/GetTheGitHub** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an __autism moods app__ to enhance interaction in a visual way.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning *JavaScript, Responsive webdesign and CSS Grid*.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source *wcag (web content accessibility guidelines)* projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coding by the wcag standard.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about __ideas and concepts for visualizing autism-help tools.__ 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on: [twitter](https://twitter.com/CodingCodera-)
- âš¡ Fun fact: besides coding for the web i like to photograph mannequins in shopping windows and i even won an award with it.
